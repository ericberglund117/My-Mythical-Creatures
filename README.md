# My-Mythical-Creatures
## A javascript teaching tool for learning about OOP

### Why?

#### I decided to brush up on my test writing skills using Mocha and Chai, which I've not used as much since migrating to React where we use Jest.  

### How to enjoy this repo:

#### clone the repo
#### npm install


#### This can also be used as a teaching tool.  To create the creatures yourself, create new dog and owner files, read the tests and use them for a Test Driven Development experience. Try and create the creature so that the tests pass.  It is recommended that you try and pass the tests one at a time and from top to bottom.  You can use the given dog.js and owner.js files as answer sheets.
