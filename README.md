# My-Mythical-Creatures
## A javascript teaching tool for learning about OOP

### Why?

#### I decided to brush up on my test writing skills using Mocha and Chai, which I've not used as much since migrating to React where we use Jest.  

### How to enjoy this repo:

#### clone the repo
#### npm install
#### To create the creatures yourself, read the test files and use them for a Test Driven Development experience. You can either comment out or delete the code for the actual creature.  That's your job!  Try and create the creature so that the tests pass.  It is recommended that you try and pass the tests one at a time.
